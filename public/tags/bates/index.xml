            Long time no see! Friends, it’s been a very busy semester and holiday season. But, I want to share some updates before the winter semester starts next week!
New Digital Exhibit I took two wonderful history classes this semester. Taking Technology in US History was an absolute highlight for me; the course started out solidly in my 18th and 19th century comfort zone, covering railroads, mills, and agriculture, but by the second half we were talking about modern technology that I regularly use but hadn’t thought about critically.
