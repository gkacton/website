**I presented my first webinar!**

I was so happy when the Rufus Porter Museum reached out to me last fall to ask if I'd be interested in presenting my summer project as part of the Museum's virtual lecture series! I was honored to have this opportunity to share this project with a bigger audience, and to have a reason to expand my research. 

***Thank you again to the Rufus Porter Museum for inviting me to speak!***
