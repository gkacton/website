**Let’s do some Nancy Drew analysis!**

Back story: I love Nancy Drew - the character, the books, and especially the point-and-click adventure games by [HerInteractive](https://www.herinteractive.com/). Even though these games are by no means the world’s most well-known computer games, there is a vibrant online presence of ND fans, including, for the past couple years, [Vote4Holt](https://www.youtube.com/@vote4holt). Comprised of brothers Julian and Jameson, Vote4Holt is a YouTube channel dedicated to all sorts of Nancy Drew content, from no-commentary playthroughs, to let’s plays, and, most importantly, the most comprehensive ND game ranking system I’ve seen.

Julian and Jameson started out by created separate rankings of the Nancy Drew games for each of six categories: story, suspects, puzzles, music, atmosphere, endings. While no ranking can be truly objective, I like this system because it forces you to consider the strengths and weaknesses of each game. Let’s say you have a game that’s a personal favorite because you, personally, really like hard puzzles; in the Vote4Holt ranking system, that only counts for 1/6 of the game’s actual score. If the other pieces of the game don’t hold up, that game really shouldn’t rank high overall, even if the puzzles are really good.

So, by virtue of breaking the game rankings into separate categories, we have the making of an awesome data set! Let’s take a look at our initial data:

<div id="htmlwidget-1" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-1">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33"],["Secrets Can Kill","Stay Tuned For Danger","Message in a Haunted Mansion","Treasure in the Royal Tower","The Final Scene","Secret of the Scarlet Hand","Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake","The Haunted Carousel","Danger on Deception Island","Secret of Shadow Ranch","Curse of Blackmoor Manor","Secret of the Old Clock","Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon","Danger by Design","Creature of Kapu Cave","White Wolf of Icicle Creek","Legend of the Crystal Skull","The Phantom of Venice","The Hauntings of Castle Malloy","Ransom of the Seven Ships","Warnings at Waverly Academy","Trail of the Twister","Shadow at the Water's Edge","The Captive Curse","Alibi in Ashes","Tomb of the Lost Queen","The Deadly Device","Ghost of Thornton Hall","The Silent Spy","The Shattered Medallion","Labyrinth of Lies","Sea of Darkness","Midnight in Salem"],["SCK","STFD","MHM","TRT","FIN","SSH","DOG","CAR","DDI","SHA","CUR","CLK","TRN","DAN","CRE","ICE","CRY","VEN","HAU","RAN","WAC","TOT","SAW","CAP","ASH","TMB","DED","GTH","SPY","MED","LIE","SEA","MID"],["starter","starter","starter","starter","starter","starter","starter","starter","starter","short","short","short","short","short","short","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","exploration","updated","updated","updated","updated","updated","updated","updated","unity"],[30,23,28,10,6,29,13,24,8,9,7,27,12,32,26,18,5,20,31,25,3,22,1,11,16,19,4,2,17,33,21,14,15],[24,9,28,14,5,31,26,22,8,16,23,29,1,12,25,19,13,30,27,33,3,20,4,18,11,21,2,7,15,32,10,6,17],[33,29,25,10,22,28,6,20,15,11,5,23,14,31,26,16,1,8,27,17,24,4,13,24,19,9,7,21,18,30,12,2,32],[30,24,16,5,9,22,1,10,4,15,11,2,6,19,26,13,20,25,17,12,27,18,8,7,31,32,14,33,21,29,23,3,28],[33,30,27,8,12,20,6,31,1,5,9,19,2,24,25,18,3,13,16,14,17,11,7,4,32,22,21,15,28,26,29,10,23],[30,6,25,23,1,21,24,8,9,5,13,27,11,32,26,19,4,29,16,28,15,22,20,7,10,12,14,2,17,33,3,18,31]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Game Number<\/th>\n      <th>Game<\/th>\n      <th>Abbreviation<\/th>\n      <th>UI<\/th>\n      <th>Story<\/th>\n      <th>Suspects<\/th>\n      <th>Puzzles<\/th>\n      <th>Music<\/th>\n      <th>Atmosphere<\/th>\n      <th>Ending<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"scrollX":true,"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[4,5,6,7,8,9]}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

You’ll notice that I’ve added a column beyond just the rankings called `ui_era`. The Nancy Drew games have used several different user interfaces over the 20+ years that the games have been made, and I was curious whether that had any impact on their rankings.

***Ranking \#1: Simple Averages***

Alright, now that we have our basic data, we can start doing some basic analysis. The first, most straightforward way to turn these scores into an overall ranking is to average all of the scores, and rank from lowest to highest. In other words, the closer the average is to 1, the better it ranks.

<div id="htmlwidget-2" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-2">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33"],["Danger on Deception Island","Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon","Legend of the Crystal Skull","Shadow at the Water's Edge","Sea of Darkness","The Final Scene","Secret of Shadow Ranch","The Deadly Device","Curse of Blackmoor Manor","Treasure in the Royal Tower","The Captive Curse","Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake","Ghost of Thornton Hall","Warnings at Waverly Academy","Trail of the Twister","Labyrinth of Lies","White Wolf of Icicle Creek","The Haunted Carousel","Tomb of the Lost Queen","The Silent Spy","Alibi in Ashes","Stay Tuned For Danger","The Phantom of Venice","Secret of the Old Clock","Ransom of the Seven Ships","The Hauntings of Castle Malloy","Midnight in Salem","Message in a Haunted Mansion","Danger by Design","Secret of the Scarlet Hand","Creature of Kapu Cave","Secrets Can Kill","The Shattered Medallion"],[7.5,7.667,7.667,8.833,8.833,9.167,10.167,10.333,11.333,11.667,11.833,12.667,13.333,14.833,16.167,16.333,17.167,19.167,19.167,19.333,19.833,20.167,20.833,21.167,21.5,22.333,24.333,24.833,25,25.167,25.667,30,30.5]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank<\/th>\n      <th>Game<\/th>\n      <th>Average Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Now we can see how the games rank if we value all categories equally. We see that *Danger on Deception Island* narrowly beats out a tie for second place between *Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon* and *Legend of the Crystal Skull*. Shockingly, *Midnight in Salem* managed to make it all the way to 27th place instead of being dead last!

*Which UI ranks best in each category?*

Let’s take a look at what happens if we group the games by their UI and average their category scores:

<div id="htmlwidget-3" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5"],["exploration","short","updated","starter","unity"],[15.2,18.833,15.714,19,15],[17.8,17.667,13.286,18.556,17],[15.3,18.333,14.143,20.889,32],[17.8,13.167,22.143,13.444,28],[13.5,14,21.571,18.667,23],[17,19,14.143,16.333,31],[16.1,16.833,16.833,17.815,24.333]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>UI<\/th>\n      <th>Story<\/th>\n      <th>Suspects<\/th>\n      <th>Puzzles<\/th>\n      <th>Music<\/th>\n      <th>Atmosphere<\/th>\n      <th>Ending<\/th>\n      <th>Overall<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3,4,5,6,7,8]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

Here, we see that the Exploration era ranks best overall, but there are some other winners in individual categories.

**What if you don’t value all categories the same?**

People have very different ideas of what makes a good Nancy Drew game. For me, puzzles are a very important part of the experience, along with suspects. For other people, the overall story might be the most important part. So, with this in mind, let’s think about some alternative rankings.

***The Vibes Ranking***

Some people love playing Nancy Drew games for the vibes. Nancy travels all over the world, and these games have some of the best video game music I’ve ever heard.

In our data set, the relevant categories for a vibes-based ranking are `music` and `atmosphere`. To get a vibes-based ranking, we should calculate a *weighted average*, in which these two categories are given a higher weight than the others. For the purpose of being able to see a difference in the data, I’ve decided to give these two categories a weight of 3, and the others a weight of 1.

<div id="htmlwidget-4" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-4">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33"],["Danger on Deception Island","Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon","Sea of Darkness","Shadow at the Water's Edge","Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake","Legend of the Crystal Skull","The Captive Curse","Treasure in the Royal Tower","The Final Scene","Secret of Shadow Ranch","Curse of Blackmoor Manor","The Deadly Device","Trail of the Twister","White Wolf of Icicle Creek","Secret of the Old Clock","Ghost of Thornton Hall","Warnings at Waverly Academy","Ransom of the Seven Ships","The Haunted Carousel","The Hauntings of Castle Malloy","The Phantom of Venice","Labyrinth of Lies","The Silent Spy","Tomb of the Lost Queen","Stay Tuned For Danger","Message in a Haunted Mansion","Secret of the Scarlet Hand","Danger by Design","Alibi in Ashes","Midnight in Salem","Creature of Kapu Cave","The Shattered Medallion","Secrets Can Kill"],[5.5,6.2,7.9,8.3,9,9.2,9.3,9.6,9.7,10.1,10.8,13.2,15.5,16.5,16.9,17.6,17.7,18.1,19.7,20,20.1,20.2,21.4,22.3,22.9,23.5,23.5,23.6,24.5,24.8,25.6,29.3,30.6]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Rank<\/th>\n      <th>Game<\/th>\n      <th>Vibes Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":2}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

*Danger on Deception Island* remains the winner, but notice that *Crystal Skull* has moved from second place all the way down to 6th place - this is because it ranked 20th for music. At the very end of the list, *Shattered Medallion* has surpassed *Secrets Can Kill*, as it should for a more vibes-based ranking; if I’m playing a game for the vibes, I’d rather be in New Zealand than a generic high school in Florida!

**Does UI factor into this ranking?**

Of all of the alternative rankings, this is the one that I hypothesize has most to do with user interface. Let’s see how each UI scores, on average:

<div id="htmlwidget-5" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-5">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5"],["exploration","updated","short","starter","unity"],[16.1,16.833,16.834,17.815,24.333],[15.92,18.843,15.533,17.111,24.8]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>UI<\/th>\n      <th>Average Base Score<\/th>\n      <th>Average Vibes Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

So, we see that while games from the Exploration era (games 16-25) rank the best in overall scores, the Short era (games 10-15) rank considerably better based on vibes.

For another visualization of which era’s games rank better on vibes, we can look at a scatterplot comparing each game’s overall score and vibes score.

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/ui-vibe-scatterplot-1.png" width="672" />

Games that fall above the line ranked higher on their vibe scores than overall scores, while points below the line scored lower on their vibes scores relative to their overall scores. Looking at this plot, we see that there are more red and peach points above the line, and more light blue points below the line. What does this mean? Games from the Exploration and Short eras tended to score higher on vibes than they do for overall scores, whereas games from the Updated UI era (games 26-32) scored worse on vibes than they did overall. Interestingly, these later games coincide with a change in the games’ music composer: Kevin Manthei composed the music for games 1-25, while Thomas Regin composed for games 26-32. While I don’t necessarily remember the earlier games as having distinctly better music, perhaps this change contributed to these games’ relatively lower scores in the vibe categories.

***The Writing Ranking***

Another perspective might argue that the quality of writing is what separates the quality of Nancy Drew games. Among the six ranked categories, there are 3 that, together, can indicate the overall rating of writing quality: `story`, `suspects`, and `endings`.

Once again, we will compute weighted averages, giving these three categories a weight of 3 while keeping the other categories at a weight of 1:

Hello, *Final Scene*!

*Does writing quality correspond to UI?*

Let’s take another look at UI, this time with relation to writing.

<div id="htmlwidget-7" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-7">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5"],["exploration","updated","short","starter","unity"],[16.1,16.833,16.834,17.815,24.333],[16.383,15.607,17.667,17.889,22.667]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>UI<\/th>\n      <th>Average Base Score<\/th>\n      <th>Average Writing Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

This time, the newer games from the Updated UI era ranked *better* on average based on their writing in comparison to their overall scores. Let’s look at a scatterplot of this data:

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/ui-writing-scatterplot-1.png" width="672" />

The points are a little more all-over-the-place this time, but we can see that the light blue points, corresponding to the Updated era, are consistently above the line, again suggesting that these games are stronger in the writing categories relative to their other scores.

***The Interaction Ranking***

The last ranking subset I wanted to look at was a combination of `puzzles` and `suspects`, because those are two key ingredients to making a game hold my attention. I’m calling this ranking the *Interaction Ranking*, because puzzles and character dialogue are two major ways that the play interacts with the game.

Once again, we’ll compute weighted averages, giving these two categories a weight of 3, while keeping the other categories at a 1:

<div id="htmlwidget-8" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-8">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","11","12","13","14","15","16","17","18","19","20","21","22","23","24","25","26","27","28","29","30","31","32","33"],["Sea of Darkness","Legend of the Crystal Skull","Last Train to Blue Moon Canyon","The Deadly Device","Shadow at the Water's Edge","Danger on Deception Island","The Final Scene","Secret of Shadow Ranch","Treasure in the Royal Tower","Curse of Blackmoor Manor","Ghost of Thornton Hall","Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake","Labyrinth of Lies","Warnings at Waverly Academy","Trail of the Twister","The Captive Curse","White Wolf of Icicle Creek","Tomb of the Lost Queen","Alibi in Ashes","The Silent Spy","Stay Tuned For Danger","The Haunted Carousel","The Phantom of Venice","Ransom of the Seven Ships","Secret of the Old Clock","Danger by Design","The Hauntings of Castle Malloy","Midnight in Salem","Message in a Haunted Mansion","Creature of Kapu Cave","Secret of the Scarlet Hand","Secrets Can Kill","The Shattered Medallion"],[6.9,7.4,7.6,8,8.7,9.1,10.9,11.5,11.8,12.4,13.6,14,14.2,14.3,14.5,15.5,17.3,17.5,17.9,18.2,19.7,19.9,20.1,22.9,23.1,23.6,24.2,24.4,25.5,25.6,26.9,29.4,30.7]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>Game<\/th>\n      <th>Interaction Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":2},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

We have yet another new winner! For interaction, *Sea of Darkness* takes first place.

*Are interaction scores related to UI?*

Let’s look at UI group averages again, this time for the new interaction scores.

<div id="htmlwidget-9" style="width:100%;height:auto;" class="datatables html-widget"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-9">{"x":{"filter":"none","vertical":false,"data":[["1","2","3","4","5"],["exploration","updated","short","starter","unity"],[16.1,16.833,16.834,17.815,24.333],[16.28,15.586,17.3,18.578,24.4]],"container":"<table class=\"display\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> <\/th>\n      <th>UI<\/th>\n      <th>Average Base Score<\/th>\n      <th>Average Interaction Score<\/th>\n    <\/tr>\n  <\/thead>\n<\/table>","options":{"columnDefs":[{"className":"dt-right","targets":[2,3]},{"orderable":false,"targets":0}],"order":[],"autoWidth":false,"orderClasses":false}},"evals":[],"jsHooks":[]}</script>

The Updated UI once again scores better in this category compared to its overall scoring average. Notably, the Starter, or original, UI (games 1-9) seems to score worse in this category. Let’s look at another scatterplot to get a better sense of this comparison:

<img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/ui-interaction-scatterplot-1.png" width="672" />

Here, we see three patterns of note:

1.  The Updated era games (light blue) are consistently above the line, meaning they generally score higher in suspects and puzzles than the other categories.

2.  The Starter era games (gold) are mostly just below the line, indicating that they score slightly worse in these categories than in other categories. Having played all 33 ND games, I’d generally say that the puzzles increase in quality and quantity as the series progresses (excluding *Midnight in Salem*, of course), so it makes sense that this first set of games is ranked lower in the interaction categories.

3.  The Exploration era games (red) are split evenly between above the line, below the line, and exactly on the line. In other words, these games are very consistent in their scores: they don’t, overall, score any higher or lower on interaction categories than they do in the other categories.

**Final Comments**

Having looked at this data extensively, I still can’t come to any definitive conclusion on what the best Nancy Drew is, or what the best *era* of ND games is. I think, generally, the Exploration era games are the most consistent in quality. But, as Julian and Jameson certainly found while working on their rankings, so much about ranking these games is subjective, and depends on what you personally value in your entertainment. I’d be really curious to see how the games would rank if we had a larger sample of fans use the same ranking system, and were able to average the data to get rid of some of the bias.

*If you’re interested in using this data, it will be up on my GitHub, so you can spare yourself the transcription time! Let me know if you come to any more conclusions, or just other ways of looking at this data.*
