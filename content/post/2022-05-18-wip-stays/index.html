<h3>Well, it’s taking a while.</h3>
<p>I started these stays in January 2021, when I wanted a compact handsewing project to take back to school with me. I worked pretty diligently on stitching the boning channels (aka, <em>100 lines of backstitching</em>), and finished that up in May 2021.</p>
<p><em>Then</em>, I ran out of steam. I was doing so much handsewing for my job at Old Sturbridge Village that I had no interest in doing more on my own time. Fall came around and I got busy with school and costume shop work and golf and the five million other things I do during the school year.</p>
<div id="tldr-i-didnt-work-on-these-at-all-for-a-year." class="section level4">
<h4>tl;dr: I didn’t work on these at all for a year.</h4>
<p>BUT, it’s Short Term! Short Term is what we do at Bates in May. We get to take one intensive course, which, in my case, meets for 2 to 5 hours a day, Monday through Thursday. This funky schedule, plus the fact that my golf season ended the first weekend in May, means that I have a ton of free time this month. So, why not go back and finally finish the stays?</p>
<p>My biggest road block was getting the motivation to bind the tabs. Like most people I <em>hate</em> binding tabs. It’s finicky and annoying, but unfortunately necessary. Honestly, once I sat down and started working on them, they really didn’t take that long. I probably took about a week to finish up the binding.</p>
<p>There were also a few structural things I had to do - namely, adding a busk pocket and a reinforcement at the waist. Those were also pretty quick, and just used up some leftover linen scraps.</p>

<h3>What’s left to do?</h3>
<p>Just putting in a lining! I’ve already finished up lining the tabs, and the body lining is pinned in. Hopefully I’ll be done within the next couple days!</p>
