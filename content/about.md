## Hi, I'm Grace!  
I'm a junior at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. I'm pursuing a self-designed interdisciplinary major in Digital Archives. I'm combining courses
      from Digital and Computational Studies (DCS) and History to explore how we
      can learn more about the lives of people in the past by using the digital 
      tools of the present.    
    
### Current Courses

Advanced Russian

Archives, Data, and Analysis

The Medieval Year

Ballet II

### Current Project at the Bates Museum of Art 

I'm currently working on helping the Bates Museum of Art develop a crowdsourcing platform to re-tag the art in our digital collection database. When the collection database was made, there was no consistent schema in place for how to tag artworks. As a result, the database is not easily searchable or filter-able, and there are several works that have no tagging beyond the object type. There are 8,000 works in the collection, making it impossible for the small museum staff to re-tag everything themselves.We are looking to use [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects) to host a crowdsourcing project, which will let art-loving volunteers provide tags for us! I'm very excited to be working on this project, and will post updates as we move forward!
