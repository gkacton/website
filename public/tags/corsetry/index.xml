            Not just wearable - finished! I’m super proud of how these turned out. It was a huge challenge to do the entire staymaking process - from drafting the pattern, to sewing boning channels, to binding tabs - entirely by myself and entirely by hand. But, it was also really rewarding. My handsewing skills have improved so much in the last year and a half, and so has my confidence in handsewing.
