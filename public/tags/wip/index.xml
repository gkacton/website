            Well, it’s taking a while. I started these stays in January 2021, when I wanted a compact handsewing project to take back to school with me. I worked pretty diligently on stitching the boning channels (aka, 100 lines of backstitching), and finished that up in May 2021.
Then, I ran out of steam. I was doing so much handsewing for my job at Old Sturbridge Village that I had no interest in doing more on my own time.
