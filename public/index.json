[{"body":"Hi, I'm Grace! I'm a junior at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. I'm pursuing a self-designed interdisciplinary major in Digital Archives. I'm combining courses from Digital and Computational Studies (DCS) and History to explore how we can learn more about the lives of people in the past by using the digital tools of the present.\nCurrent Courses Advanced Russian\nArchives, Data, and Analysis\nThe Medieval Year\nBallet II\nCurrent Project at the Bates Museum of Art I'm currently working on helping the Bates Museum of Art develop a crowdsourcing platform to re-tag the art in our digital collection database. When the collection database was made, there was no consistent schema in place for how to tag artworks. As a result, the database is not easily searchable or filter-able, and there are several works that have no tagging beyond the object type. There are 8,000 works in the collection, making it impossible for the small museum staff to re-tag everything themselves.We are looking to use Zooniverse to host a crowdsourcing project, which will let art-loving volunteers provide tags for us! I'm very excited to be working on this project, and will post updates as we move forward!\n","link":"https://example.com/about/","section":"","tags":null,"title":"About"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/bates/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Bates"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"body":" Long time no see! Friends, it’s been a very busy semester and holiday season. But, I want to share some updates before the winter semester starts next week!\nNew Digital Exhibit I took two wonderful history classes this semester. Taking Technology in US History was an absolute highlight for me; the course started out solidly in my 18th and 19th century comfort zone, covering railroads, mills, and agriculture, but by the second half we were talking about modern technology that I regularly use but hadn’t thought about critically. It really gave me a new lens on “digital history” – this time meaning the history of digital tools, rather than using those tools for historical work.\nMy other history class was called Upstairs, Downstairs, and Outside: The Household in British History and was also right up my alley! I never had a chance to take a European history class in high school, so I was very fortunate to find a British history survey course that was based in a topic that I’m very comfortable with.\nFor my final project in the British history class, I created a digital exhibit on food policy during the World Wars. I had so much fun looking through museum collections for posters, recipes, advertisements, photos, and other artifacts. Check it out here!\n Ongoing Internship at the Bates Museum I was very fortunate to have a spot in the Bates Art Museum internship course last semester, and I’m so happy to say that I’ll be continuing my work next semester! The museum has asked me to develop a crowdsourcing platform to allow volunteers to help update the tags and descriptions of objects in our publicly-available collections database. I’ve been having a blast playing around with the ArtUK Tagger interface, and similar projects built with Zooniverse. We ultimately decided to use Zooniverse for our own platform, and I’m looking forward to fine-tuning our questions and user interface!\n Next Semester’s Classes This winter semester I’m taking three academic courses and ballet, which gives me more time to work on my museum project. For academics, I’m taking my final Advanced Russian course, a history class on celebrations and daily life in Medieval Europe, and a data-science-slash-history class called Archives, Data, and Analysis. This is the last DCS/History class I have left, meaning I’m basically done with my major, other than completing my thesis!\nI’ll likely be blogging much more next semester - I have a lot of digital history work coming up that I’d really like to share! Beyond the Zooniverse museum project and my DCS/History class, I’m also working on expanding my Rufus Porter project using data from Zillow. I think this will be a really fun and engaging semester academically, and I look forward to sharing my progress with all of you!\n  ","link":"https://example.com/post/new-project/","section":"post","tags":["Bates","Rufus Porter"],"title":"New Year, New Post"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/post/","section":"post","tags":["index"],"title":"Posts"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/research/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"research"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/rufus-porter/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Rufus Porter"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/nancy-drew/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Nancy Drew"},{"body":" It’s up to you as Nancy Drew… Did you know that between 1998 and 2015, the video game company HER Interactive released 32 Nancy Drew PC point-and-click adventure games? If you’ve spent any time with me in real life, then you definitely know about them, since I love them and talk about them constantly. I very regularly start a sentence with “Well, there’s this one Nancy Drew game where…”\nThe games are great. Even the ones from the late 90s, despite their, uh, outdated style and interface problems (looking at you, Stay Tuned for Danger).\n Figure 1: Dwayne Pooooowersssss  I’m not here to talk about all of these fantastic games, though. Just two in particular - the two MUSEUM INTERNSHIP games. Yes, Nancy Drew is an intern at a museum for not one, but two of these games.\nND6: Secret of the Scarlet Hand Our first museum-themed entry in the Nancy Drew universe takes us back to 2002, the year after I was born. In Secret of the Scarlet Hand, Nancy’s rich dad’s rich friend, Franklin Rose, sets her up with a Deputy Curator position at the Beech Hill Museum in Washington, D.C.. Don’t worry, the job is unpaid - this is a museum, after all.\nTo be more specific, the Beech Hill Museum specializes in the ancient Maya civilization. Our cast of characters includes Joanna Riggs, the museum’s curator; Henrick van der Hune, an expert in Mayan glyphs; Alejandro del Rio, an employee of the Mexican consulate; and Taylor Sinclair, a shady art dealer who offers you suspicious Oaxacan cookies. Nancy’s task list starts off with your classic museum intern tasks: reordering supplies, fixing a broken audio tour system, rearranging exhibit labels, and testing out some interactive displays.\nHowever, there is quickly a turn of events: the Museum’s precious jade carving of King Pacal is stolen! To add to the intrigue, the thief leaves behind a piece of paper with nothing but a Mayan glyph and a scary red handprint on it. Being an amateur sleuth, Nancy is immediately on the case. She calls the other museums and private collectors that own similar carvings, only to discover that some of their pieces have been stolen as well.\nI won’t spoil it all, but it’s a great story. There’s a ring of smugglers, forged provenance documentation, and, to top it all off, one character falls off the giant replica pyramid exhibit and gets amnesia. Amazing.\n ND31: Labyrinth of Lies Released in 2014, Labyrinth of Lies is Nancy’s second museum internship, and this time she gets to go all the way to Greece! The Phidias Cultural Center has hired Nancy to assist in preparations for a special exhibit that will coincide with the premiere of a play called Persephone in Winter. When Nancy arrives, however, things take a dramatic turn. The museum curator, Melina Rossi, is nowhere to be found. When Nancy finally gets a call from her, Melina reveals that most of the museum staff have quit, and there are artifacts missing.\nOur cast of characters is equally kooky in this game. The first person we meet is Xenia Doukas, the lead actress and director of Persephone in Winter. Melina has essentially left the museum in Xenia’s extremely underqualified hands. Xenia spends her time in the gorgeous amphitheater next to the museum, doing…who knows what. She has a notepad and a heavily annotated script, so I guess she’s doing director stuff. Next we have Niobe Papadaki, a quiet artist struggling to balance the role of Demeter and her prop-making responsibilities. There is also Grigor Karakinos, a theater techie who has been roped into playing Hermes in the play in addition to all of his technological duties. Lastly, we have Thanos Ganas, a convicted murderer and member of a criminal organization called Kronos. He’s playing Hades, duh.\nThis one’s plot gets kind of unhinged, but it’s fantastic. Once again, I will refrain from spoiling anything, but Nancy’s task list has a classic museum intern level of randomness. Her responsibilities range from printing tickets for the play and making seating charts, to doing actual object study and provenance research to determine which artifacts in the museum have been replaced with fakes.\n What made this a “Nancy Drew Summer”? I solved no great mystery this summer. I wasn’t even really presented with any kind of mystery, except for maybe the ongoing puzzle that is attribution of Rufus Porter School landscape murals (Which I may have made progress on! More on that in another post).\nBut, to me, a Nancy Drew game isn’t just about the primary mystery.\nHistorical Subplots Almost every Nancy Drew game has a secondary, historical plot. In Scarlet Hand, it’s about an ancient Mayan scribe and her tomb. In other games, we’ve have had a World War II spy story (Danger by Design), an Old West outlaw romance (Secret of Shadow Ranch), and a Prohibition-era gangster (Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake). In the process of investigating whatever theft, kidnapping, murder, vandalism, eccentric fashion designer, game show, or ghost has come to her attention, Nancy will also uncover more information about this other topic. Often, the two intertwine.\nMy historical subplot of particular interest this summer was Jonathan D. Poor and the art he left behind. Jonathan Poor, aka JDP, was Rufus Porter’s nephew; his mother was Rufus’s sister, Ruth Porter Poor. He was born near Sebago Lake in Baldwin, Maine in 1807. JDP probably learned to paint through a sort of apprenticeship with his uncle during the 1820s. At this time, Rufus was mostly working on watercolor portraits and hollow-cut silhouettes, but some Porter School landscape murals have been dated to this period as well.\nJDP’s first signed and dated work is from 1830, painted in the Silas Burbank House of Mount Vernon. 6 panels from this house are now owned by the Rufus Porter Museum, and another one is installed at the Scottish Rite Masonic Museum and Library in Lexington, Massachusetts.\n Figure 2: J.D. Poor, 1930 signature from the Silas Burbank House. Image from “Rediscovering the Murals of Jonathan D. Poor” by Jane E. Radcliff. https://www.afanews.com/articles/item/525-rediscovering-the-murals-of-jonathan-d-poor     ","link":"https://example.com/post/2022-06-27-my-nancy-drew-summer/","section":"post","tags":["Nancy Drew","Rufus Porter","summer 2022"],"title":"Other Duties as Assigned: Recapping My Nancy Drew Summer"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/summer-2022/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"summer 2022"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/r/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"R"},{"body":"  That is the question… Shiny is one of my favorite R packages.\nFor those who aren’t R enthusiasts (or those who are but haven’t yet been introduced to Shiny), Shiny is an R package that allows you to create interactive applications. With a single script, you can super easily create a UI and server that will take user input and generate graphs, tables, text, and even maps.\nSo far, I’ve mostly used Shiny to level up my leaflet game. With Shiny, you can let users filter points and polygons on a leaflet map by pretty much any variable in your data set. In my Short Term course, Community Engaged Data Science, we used the interactivity of Shiny to make a Lyme disease dashboard for the Maine Medical Center Vector-Borne Disease Lab. The app lets you choose which polygon overlays you want to see, so you can toggle between potential indicators of Lyme disease outbreaks.\nShiny is a great tool for upgrading leaflet maps and making other interactive apps, but…\nHosting Shiny apps kind of sucks.\nThe only reasonably straightforward way to do it, to the best of my knowledge, is through shinyapps.io. The shinyapps hosting is good in theory, but in practice, it’s been incredibly frustrating. Let’s look at some pros and cons:\n  Pros  Cons      Host for free.  Free version limits you to 1 GB of memory.    Designed to work with and deploy directly from the RStudio console.  Figuring out how to deploy for the first time is super confusing.    Lets you deploy to multiple different accounts.  If you don’t check which account is currently linked, you can deploy to the wrong account without noticing (sorry, Dr. Baker!)     My main qualm is the limited memory. Here’s the aforementioned Lyme disease dashboard:\n  Figure 1: Lyme disease Shiny app. Apologies if it doesn’t work - proof that Shiny hosting is super inconsistent.  This is dramatically pared down from what we intended to include. We had two other diseases that we were looking at (Anaplasmosis and Babesiosis, in case there are any tick scholars present), but adding the polygon layers made it too big to host. We also had passive tick submission data, but, again, couldn’t add it to the dashboard because it got too big. I’m still happy with how this turned out, but because we were making this dashboard for researchers rather than the public, I really wanted to include all of the data they gave us, instead of one out of six of their data sets.\n My current Shiny project As I talked about in my last post, my research project during my time at Rufus Porter is to make an interactive map of the art of the Rufus Porter School. When I last wrote about this project, I was completely fed up with Shiny, and was going to stop using it. But, I have since fixed many issues, and am now back on track with Shiny.\nA Problem and Solution When my app wasn’t running, I immediately assumed that it was because I was using leaflet again and leaflet maps get big very quickly. But, it turns out that was not the case! I have been using the fontAwesome package to make awesomeIcons for my map, and I had forgotten to call library(fontAwesome) at the beginning of my app script. It was such a simple solution, but it took forever to figure it out! The package was already loaded in RStudio, so there were no error messages or anything when I ran the app locally. And, because the package was already installed, I didn’t get an error when I deployed it; I just got an “Application failed to start” message on the shinyapps page that was hosting it. This message has like a dozen potential causes, but, luckily, I found this article in the shinyapps FAQs, and when through each potential cause until I figured it out. So, if you’re using Shiny, make sure you have a library() call for every single package you’re using.\n Preview So, now that my Shiny map app is successfully deployed, here is a little preview! Right now I’m using the sidebarPanel layout with the main panel being a tabsetPanel, but I’ve also been playing around with the fluid grid system that underlies all Shiny layouts.\nThis is far from a finished product - there are still a lot of images missing that I know I can find, and the artist information pages are all just quick little drafts I wrote from memory.\nFeel free to let me know what you think in the comments!\n   ","link":"https://example.com/post/2022-06-14-to-shiny-or-not-to-shiny/","section":"post","tags":["R","Rufus Porter","summer 2022"],"title":"To Shiny or Not to Shiny"},{"body":"  Figure 1: Mural from the Francis Howe House, painted by Rufus Porter and Stephen Twombly Porter in 1838. Photo by David Bohl via the University of Maine.  Happy summer! This week I started my summer internship at the Rufus Porter Museum of Art and Ingenuity in Bridgton, Maine. The RPM is a very small museum - I’m one of three employees at the moment - so I really get to see all the different sides of running a museum.\nWhat’ve I been up to? A bunch of things! My main job has been to get up to speed on all the background information and context about Rufus Porter. I’ve also been working on my research project, which is to map Rufus Porter’s travels. So, I’ve mostly been doing a lot of reading about Porter, and making a database of his artwork and known residences.\n Our Rufus Porter Sources The first major work of scholarship on Rufus Porter was Jean Lipman’s 1968 book Rufus Porter: Yankee Pioneer, which she updated and republished in 1980 as Rufus Porter: Rediscovered. Lipman tried her best to catalog all of the Rufus Porter School murals, and to attribute them to specific artists where she could. But, she was a little bit overeager when it came to these attributions, and named Rufus Porter himself as the creator of dozens of them all over New England. It’s possible that Porter did paint all of these - he was known to be an itinerant artist from roughly 1815 to 1840-ish - but there were also many other itinerant artists at the time who painted in a similar style. Porter had at least two known protegees: his son, Stephen Twombly Porter, and his nephew, Jonathan D. Poor. Plus, Porter published instructions for landscape painting in his Curious Arts book, so it is likely that other painters learned his style that way. So, Lipman’s book is still considered reliable for biographical information on Porter, but her listing of his murals has been reconsidered.\nIn 2011, Linda Carter Lefko and Jane E. Radcliffe published Folk Art Murals of the Rufus Porter School, which is much more careful when it comes to attributing specific works to specific artists. They go in detail on the three murals that Rufus Porter actually signed, as well as the 12 signed murals by Jonathan D. Poor. Another interesting element of the Lefko/Radcliffe book is that multiple Porter School murals were uncovered after Lipman’s study, and are examined for the first time in the 2011 book.\nThere are also some murals that Lipman included in her index, but that she did not have an opportunity to study in person, in which Lefko and Radcliffe discovered signatures. These were all done by J.D. Poor, who was very clever about his signatures. He included his classic block-lettered “J.D. Poor” in inconspicuous places on his murals - sign posts, sides of boats, between trees. These are two of my favorites: the “Hotel J.D.P.” from the overmantle painting in the Warren Pederson House in Standish, ME, and the “J.D. Poor” paddle boat wheel from the Oliver Prescott House in Groton, MA.\n Figure 2: Images from “Rediscovering Jonathan D. Poor” by Jane E. Radcliffe on AFANews.com.  The last, and most recent, work of Rufus Porter scholarship is Rufus Porter’s Curious World: Art and Invention in America, 1815-1860, which was edited by Laura French Sprague and Justin Wolff in 2019 as a companion to the Bowdoin College Museum of Art exhibit of the same name. Unfortunately, this exhibit opened in late 2019, and, like everything else, had to close in March 2020. This exhibit and book were much more focused on Porter’s time as an itinerant portrait painter and his scientific endeavors. The chapter on portraiture was very helpful for my research project, as Porter’s travels were not limited to his time as a muralist. Although, like his murals, Porter rarely signed his portraits, he was very diligent in labeling his works with the subject’s name, what town they lived in, and what year the portrait was painted.\nI also just think Porter’s portrait style is adorable. We have some of them on display at the Museum right now, and I love to just hang out in the portrait room and stare at them. It’s difficult to tell in a digital image, but Porter’s portraits are very small - most are on roughly 4” x 6” cards, or smaller. His style is so delicate and charming, and it makes his work distinctive. Even though he only signed one or two known portraits, Porter’s portrait works are more easily attributable to him than his murals are. Obviously, nobody can be 100% certain without a signature, but folk art historians seem to find it easy to agree on Rufus Porter portraits.\n Figure 3: Portrait of Jacob Davis of Minot, ME, painted by Rufus Porter, ca. 1815. Image from the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, MA.   R Tidbits To put all of this together into a map, I’ll be using my favorite R package, leaflet. I love leaflet because of how easily you can customize the appearance and functionality of your maps. During my Short Term course, I learned a lot of new features for leaflet which I hadn’t used before, including awesomeMarkers, addLayersControl, and mapPanes.\nThe layer control functions are already proving to be very helpful because of the sheer number of data points I have. Including all of the Rufus Porter School murals and portraits from the three books I mentioned, I have 178 works to include on the map. The layer controls will let people filter by artist attribution and medium (mural vs portrait), which will make the map much more functional and readable.\nI’ve also been playing around with Shiny to make an animated map. This one adds the works to the map in chronological order, and lets you filter by artist. But, I am quickly running in to the problem I’ve had with Shiny in the past, which is how uncooperative it is when it comes to actually hosting the app online. To the best of my knowledge, the only place to host a Shiny app is on shinyapps.io, but the free version of shinyapps has a super limited memory. The very preliminary version of the animated map is already too big to run, even though it runs perfectly fast when I run it locally. I’m very frustrated with the hosting issue, so I think I will back away from using Shiny for this project. I think gganimate might have some options for maps, which I will be exploring soon.\nI’ll post an in-progress version of the map once it is actually in a state to share, which it obviously is not after just one week of work!\n What’s happening this week? It’s opening week! On Friday we have our preview party, and Saturday is opening day. Saturday is also the Bridgton Second Saturday Art Walk, and we’re on the map! I’ve been studying up on the exhibit information and practicing my tour talk, but I think we have a very eager crew of docents for opening day, so I will mostly be support. Maybe I’ll get to hang out in the portrait room…\n Figure 4: The view from the top of Pleasant Mountain, near Rufus Porter’s childhood home, which I hiked on Sunday.

I’m super proud of how these turned out. It was a huge challenge to do the entire staymaking process - from drafting the pattern, to sewing boning channels, to binding tabs - entirely by myself and entirely by hand. But, it was also really rewarding. My handsewing skills have improved so much in the last year and a half, and so has my confidence in handsewing. Now I feel ready to move on to actual visible garments (and to altering some existing ones).\nThe Pattern When I set out on this staymaking journey, I didn’t initially plan on drafting the pattern myself. I really love the look of the Augusta Stays by Scroop Patterns, but they’re a bit later of a pattern than I wanted. I was aiming for 1770s, and the Augusta pattern is clearly the prow-front style of the 1780s. The commercial American Duchess pattern was closer to the shape I wanted, but I ran into sizing issues. I am not particularly squishable, and lacing down more than an inch or two irritates my ribs. In order to fit my bust measurement, the waist would’ve been about three inches too small - way too tight for my asthmatic lungs.\nLuckily, stays are actually super easy to draft if you think about the geometry. It’s really just a matter of creating a cone-shaped base, then cutting it into pieces. The only measurements you actually need are a bust circumference, waist circumference, and the distance between the two. Mariah Pattie explains it better in her YouTube video.\nHooray, math!\nIn terms of the actual pattern piece shapes and overall look, I kind of smooshed together the Augusta and American Duchess patterns, along with some extant examples. I love the look and potential adjustability of having the front lace halfway down. Down the line, I can probably fake the prow-front shape by loosening this front lacing and padding out the bust a little bit. I made the front pretty much fully-boned, but kept the sides a little bit less boned to avoid irritating my ribs too much.\n What’s up with the straps? I had no idea what I was doing, but I like how they turned out! I first saw this criss-cross strap style on the American Duchess stays, and was very perplexed. Every other stays pattern had the typical lace-on straps, but the criss-cross feels so much more straightforward. I just used pieces of linen tape, leftover from the binding. Later on, I might want to switch this out for a bias tape or twill-weave tape, since either of those will have a little bit more stretch, but the plain weave works fine for now. To keep the straps from crossing too high up on my neck, there is a piece of the narrower linen tape at the top of each back panel. The straps are secured by tucking them underneath the tabs, and tying them in a knot at center front. I think you can also secure them with a hook and eye on each side of the center front, but I’m going to hold off on that until I decide whether I want to switch it out for twill tape. Overall, I really like this style! It makes me hold my shoulders back in proper 18th-century posture, and is much easier to secure on myself than having to tie a bow at each shoulder.\n Construction I already went into a lot of detail on construction on my previous post, so check that out if you want to know more!\n What’s next? Next week, I start my summer job at the Rufus Porter Museum. I’m so excited to get started! I’m also excited to have more free time than I do during the school year. I have a few projects planned for the summer, mostly in the 1770s-1780s time range. Last year I made a handsewn Italian gown, which currently has some major fit issues. My old stays had almost no shape, so the bodice of the gown is way too big. I am planning on recutting it into a zone-front, and adding more trim. I also plan on finishing the matching petticoat, which I started quite a while ago, and making a false rump to achieve the proper early-1780s silhouette. Oh, and I also currently don’t have a shift of any kind because I cut my old one up, so that’s kind of a must before I do much else!\nNow I just need to find things to actually get dressed up for…\n  ","link":"https://example.com/post/completed-stays/","section":"post","tags":["18th Century","Handsewing","Corsetry"],"title":"Completed 1770s Stays "},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/corsetry/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Corsetry"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/handsewing/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"Handsewing"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/categories/sewing/","section":"categories","tags":null,"title":"Sewing"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/wip/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"WIP"},{"body":" Well, it’s taking a while. I started these stays in January 2021, when I wanted a compact handsewing project to take back to school with me. I worked pretty diligently on stitching the boning channels (aka, 100 lines of backstitching), and finished that up in May 2021.\nThen, I ran out of steam. I was doing so much handsewing for my job at Old Sturbridge Village that I had no interest in doing more on my own time. Fall came around and I got busy with school and costume shop work and golf and the five million other things I do during the school year.\ntl;dr: I didn’t work on these at all for a year. BUT, it’s Short Term! Short Term is what we do at Bates in May. We get to take one intensive course, which, in my case, meets for 2 to 5 hours a day, Monday through Thursday. This funky schedule, plus the fact that my golf season ended the first weekend in May, means that I have a ton of free time this month. So, why not go back and finally finish the stays?\nMy biggest road block was getting the motivation to bind the tabs. Like most people I hate binding tabs. It’s finicky and annoying, but unfortunately necessary. Honestly, once I sat down and started working on them, they really didn’t take that long. I probably took about a week to finish up the binding.\nThere were also a few structural things I had to do - namely, adding a busk pocket and a reinforcement at the waist. Those were also pretty quick, and just used up some leftover linen scraps.\n  What’s left to do? Just putting in a lining! I’ve already finished up lining the tabs, and the body lining is pinned in. Hopefully I’ll be done within the next couple days!\n Materials, Resources, References Fabric and thread from Burnley and Trowbridge.\nDrafting method from Mariah Pattie.\nOther helpful references:\n- The American Duchess Blog, especially the boning patterns article.\n- Gracie Patten’s blog.\n ","link":"https://example.com/post/wip-stays/","section":"post","tags":["18th Century","Handsewing","WIP"],"title":"Work in Progress: 18th Century Stays"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/archives/","section":"","tags":null,"title":""},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/tags/index/","section":"tags","tags":null,"title":"index"},{"body":"","link":"https://example.com/series/","section":"series","tags":null,"title":"Series"}]
